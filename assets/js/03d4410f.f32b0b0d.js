Finally let `f` be an uninterpreted function that takes one argument of type (aka sort) integer and results in an integer value.

A formula/constraint `F` is ",(0,i.kt)("b",null,"satisfiable")," if there is some assignment of appropriate values to its uninterpreted  symbols under which `F` evaluates to true. Validity is about finding a proof of a statement; satisfiability is about finding a solution to a set of constraints. Consider a formula `F` containing `a` and `b`. We can ask whether `F` is valid, that is whether it is always true for any combination of values for `a` and `b`. If `F` is always true, then `Not(F)` is always false, and then `Not(F)` will not have any satisfying assignment (i.e., solution); that is, `Not(F)` is unsatisfiable. That is, `F` is valid precisely when `Not(F)` is not satisfiable (is unsatisfiable). Alternately, `F` is satisfiable if and only if `Not(F)` is not valid (is invalid). The following example proves the deMorgan's law. The following example redefines the Z3Py function `prove` that receives a formula as a parameter. This function creates a solver, adds/asserts the negation of the formula, and check if the negation is unsatisfiable.
